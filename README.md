# GPequation
This repository serves as the management of my undergraduate research programming.

## Programme description
This programme is aim to calculate the GP equation under one-dimensional potential, using imaginary time evolution and a modification of Hamiltonian to seek equaiton's corresponding ground state's and excited states' energies and wave functions.

## Notice to readers and potential contributors 
Detail description of ideas and procedures will not be uploaded to the internet, for this repository is created for private uses. If you want to know my research details, or want to cooperate, please contact me via email.
